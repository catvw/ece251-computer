# Report on the Design and Implementation of an 8-Bit Computer in Verilog
Designed by Charles Van West throughout Spring '22.

# Instruction Set Architecture
The first task for this computer was the design of the ISA. Since I did not
want overly complex control logic, I created something as close to a MISC
architecture as possible.

## General Choices
Instructions are 8 bits long, so as to be loadable in a single cycle. Unlike
the 4004, which heavily inspired this computer, there are no two-byte
instructions for simplicity. Opcodes usually take up 4 or 5 bits, depending on
the instruction; the rest is reserved for a register specification or an
immediate. Since space within an instruction is highly constrained, this
computer uses an accumulator as both an argument and target register for most
instructions.
